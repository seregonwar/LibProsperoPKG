# PS5 Package Format — Technical Write-up

This document describes the structure of a PS5 package and the end-to-end
process LibProsperoPkg follows to create one. It is a technical reference for developers working
with the format; the offsets and field names below match the library's own reader, builder and
finalizer.

> Endianness is mixed: the outer container (`\x7FCNT`) header is **big-endian**, while the
> finalized-image (`\x7FFIH`) header fields are **little-endian**. This is called out per section.

---

## 1. Overview

A complete, installable PS5 package is a **finalized image** with the magic `\x7FFIH`. It wraps
a **metadata container** with the magic `\x7FCNT`,
together with a shared, encrypted **PFS** image holding the actual
application files.

At the highest level a finished package is four consecutive segments:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ FIH   header + finalization digest table   (0x00000–0x10000)  │  little-endian
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ PFS   shared AES-XTS-encrypted outer PFS image                │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ SC    embedded \x7FCNT metadata container                     │  big-endian header
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ SI    install-metadata archive                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The console reports these segments as **FIH / PFS / SC / SI**.

## 2. The metadata container (`\x7FCNT`)

The `\x7FCNT` container holds the package metadata: the entry table, the content id, and the
descriptor entries (param.json, icons, PlayGo data, license, digests, keys, …). It is metadata
only — by itself it is **not** an installable package.

### 2.1 Header (big-endian)

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Magic | `0x7F 'C' 'N' 'T'` |
| Flags | Container flags |
| Entry count | Number of records in the entry table |
| Entry-table offset | File offset of the first entry-meta record |
| Body offset / size | Region holding the entry payloads |
| Content ID | 36-character ASCII identifier, stored in a `0x30`-byte field |
| DRM type / content type | Package classification |

The container header region is `0x5A0` bytes.

### 2.2 Entry table

The entry table is an array of fixed-size **`0x20`-byte** records. Each record describes one
entry:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Id | A well-known entry id (see below) |
| Name-table offset | Offset of the entry's name within the `EntryNames` (`0x0200`) table |
| Flags | Includes the encrypted-entry flag (`0x80000000` in `Flags1`) |
| Data offset / size | Location and length of the entry payload |

Entry names are resolved from the `ENTRY_NAMES` table (entry id `0x0200`).

### 2.3 Well-known entry ids

The subset relevant to inspection and
creation:

| Id | Entry |
|---|---|
| `0x0001` | Digests |
| `0x0010` | Entry keys |
| `0x0020` | Image key |
| `0x0080` | General digests |
| `0x0100` | Metas |
| `0x0200` | Entry names |
| `0x0400` / `0x0401` | License data / license info |
| `0x0402` / `0x0403` / `0x0404` | `nptitle.dat` / `npbind.dat` / `selfinfo.dat` |
| `0x0407` / `0x0408` | `target-deltainfo.dat` / `origin-deltainfo.dat` |
| `0x040A` | `imagedigs.dat` (**unnamed** entry) — `N × 32` outer-block digest table |
| `0x1001` | `playgo-chunk.dat` |
| `0x1004` / `0x1005` | `pronunciation.xml` / `pronunciation.sig` |
| `0x1007` | `pubtoolinfo.dat` |
| `0x1200` / `0x1220` / `0x1240` | `icon0.png` / `pic0.png` / `snd0.at9` |
| `0x1260`+ | `changeinfo/changeinfo.xml` (and `changeinfo_NN.xml`) |
| `0x1280` / `0x12A0` / `0x12C0` / `0x2060` | `icon0.dds` / `pic0.dds` / `pic1.dds` / `pic2.dds` |
| `0x1600`+ | `keymap_rp/...` Remote Play key-map images |
| `0x2000` | `param.json` |
| `0x2010` / `0x2011` | `playgo-hash-table.dat` / `playgo-ficm.dat` |

> A `nwonly` debug CNT carries 13 entries:
> `0x0001 0x0010 0x0020 0x0080 0x0100 0x0200 0x040A 0x1001 0x1200 0x1280 0x2000 0x2010 0x2011`
> (no license entries). `imagedigs.dat` (`0x040A`) is the only **unnamed** body entry. The
> license, network-platform, self-info, delta-info, keymap_rp, changeinfo and pronunciation entries
> are added only when the source folder supplies those files (see §8.1).

## 3. The PFS image

The application's files live inside a **PFS** image. There are two
nested images:

- The **inner image** holds the actual file tree (`uroot`): `sce_sys/`, `eboot.bin`, data, etc.
- The **outer image** wraps the inner image (optionally compressed) plus the metadata, and is
  the segment that the finalized image references.

### 3.1 Layout

The inner PFS image is laid out from the prepared folder:

1. The folder tree is walked and turned into PFS directory and file inodes.
2. Inode tables, the directory structure and the data region are written.
3. A superblock records the image geometry and the format version (always 2 for PS5).

The resulting plaintext image reads back byte-for-byte through the PFS reader.

### 3.2 Merkle integrity

PFS protects its data with a **SHA-256 Merkle** hash tree: each block's hash rolls up through
parent levels to a root, so any tampering is detectable. This is built as part of the image.

### 3.3 Encryption (AES-XTS)

The image is encrypted with **AES-XTS** over **`0x1000`-byte (4 KiB) sectors**:

1. The **EKPFS** (encrypted-key PFS) roots the key schedule. For the **inner PFS image**, the
   EKPFS is derived from the content id and passcode using SHA3-256. For the **shared outer
   finalized-image PFS**, the EKPFS is the `pfs-image-key` stored in the package metadata (it
   is *not* the passcode-derived inner key) and is consumed directly.
2. From the EKPFS and the 16-byte superblock **seed**, the per-image key material (tweak key,
   data key, sign key) is derived using the SHA3-256-based `new_crypt` key schedule.

   The XTS sector number is the **image-relative** sector index (the first encrypted sector is
   tweak 0), with a `0x1000` sector size.
3. Every sector except the plaintext header block is encrypted; the encryption flag and the
   seed are stamped in the superblock.

`Util/Crypto.cs` (`PfsGenCryptoKey`/`PfsGenEncKey`/`PfsGenSignKey`) implements this
schedule.

The header (block 0) stays plaintext because the kernel needs to read the superblock before it
has the keys. The encrypted image decrypts back byte-for-byte.

### 3.4 Compression (PFSC)

The inner image can optionally be stored as a **PFSC** container — a block-compressed form that
substantially reduces the dominant size driver (`pfs_image.dat`). Each block is compressed
independently; incompressible blocks (and incompressible images as a whole) fall back to a raw
wrapper. A PFSC image decompresses back to a valid, mountable inner PFS.

---

## 4. Metadata signing

The package metadata is signed with **RSA-3072, PKCS#1 v1.5, SHA-256**. The same key material
drives the EKPFS/PFS key derivation used for the inner-image encryption. The signer verifies the
published key fingerprint and performs a sign/verify round-trip before use.

---

## 5. The finalized image (`\x7FFIH`)

Finalization wraps the `\x7FCNT` container and the shared PFS image into the installable
`\x7FFIH` image.

### 5.1 Header (little-endian)

| Offset | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `0x00` | Magic | `0x7F 'F' 'I' 'H'` |
| `0x05` | Signed byte | `0x00` = debug, `0x80` = retail/submitted |
| `0x10` | PFS image offset | u64; always `0x10000` |
| `0x18` | PFS image size | u64 |
| `0x58` | Embedded CNT (SC) offset | u64 |
| `0xA0` | Embedded CNT (SC) size | u64 |

The header + digest-table region is always **`0x10000`** bytes, and the PFS segment always
begins at `0x10000`. The FIH offset (`0`) and FIH size (`0x10000`) are constant; only the
segment sizes vary.

### 5.2 The signed byte

The single byte at offset `0x05` is what distinguishes a **debug** finalized image (`0x00`)
from a **retail/submitted** one (`0x80`). A console in debug mode relaxes finalized-image
verification and accepts the debug variant.

### 5.3 Finalization digest table

The remainder of the FIH region holds the finalized digests. The `game-digest` (`0x30`/`0x70`/`0xD0`)
is `SHA3-256` of the plaintext outer superblock, and the embedded CNT carries the package-digest
self-seal, the CNT-header rollup, the per-entry digest table and the GeneralDigests block
(content/header/system/param/playgo/target). LibProsperoPkg reproduces **all of these byte-exact**
(verified against four real debug packages). The FIH `0xB0` slot — `SHA3-256` of the **uncompressed
inner PFS image** at its plain size — is implemented and threaded through
the build path; like every digest its value bit-matches a specific reference package only once the inner
Kraken encoder is byte-identical, but the formula is exact and gated self-consistent.
See [implementation-status.md](implementation-status.md).

### 5.4 The SI segment

The image ends with a trailing **STORED ZIP** archive of install-time metadata. Verified
member order against reference debug packages (every member uncompressed / `STORED`):

| Path | Notes |
|---|---|
| `common/etc/naps_meta_18.dat` | per-package **keyed** metric blob; size varies (e.g. 3440 / 7936 B). No off-console producer — supplied verbatim when available, otherwise **omitted** (never fabricated). |
| `common/etc/naps_meta_300.dat` | 48 B; reproduced byte-exact (`R = alignUp(pfs_image.dat) - 0x10000` at 0x10/0x20, kind id `0x3E9` at 0x18, block size `0x10000` at 0x28) |
| `common/etc/naps_meta_301.dat` | 48 B, byte-identical to `_300` |
| `common/etc/naps_meta_302.dat` | 48 B, byte-identical to `_300` |
| `common/etc/naps_meta_308.dat` | 48 B, byte-identical to `_300` |
| `common/etc/pfsimage.xml` | machine-readable image descriptor (see below) |
| `common/etc/playgo-chunk.dat` | 416 B; identical to the CNT `0x1001` copy |
| `config/<content-id>/playgo-chunk.crc` | CRC-32C per 64 KiB block of the mount image |

The SI segment is **emitted automatically** by the `nwonly` build: `ProsperoPkgBuilder` captures the
reproducible `pfsimage.xml` options, the CNT `playgo-chunk.dat`, and the block-aligned inner-image size
during the CNT build, and `ProsperoFihBuilder.BuildFromCnt` appends the ZIP produced by
`ProsperoSiArchive.BuildDebugSiSegment` after the embedded CNT. `BuildMembers` → `WriteZip` reproduce the
member order, paths, `STORED` framing and `naps_meta_30x` identity exactly; the `playgo-chunk.crc` is
recomputed from the finalized mount image (CRC-32C). The `naps_meta_300` `R` is the inner-image
data-region size and is legitimately `0` when the inner image fits in one 0x10000 block (tiny synthetic
inputs); real multi-MB game/app content yields the expected non-zero value (e.g. `0x40000` for the
reference Downloads package).

`pfsimage.xml` is reproduced faithfully through its `<config>`, `<digests>`, `<params>`,
`<container>`, `<mount-image>` and `<entries>` sections — including the toolchain constants
`<version-date>0x20200722</version-date>` / `<version-hash>0x01fe52e9</version-hash>`, the derived
`<longname>`, the full container/mount geometry and the CNT entry table, all populated with the build's
own self-consistent digests. The deep `<chunkinfo>`/`<pfs-image>` (outer PFS) / `<nested-image>` (inner
PFS) introspection trees are now emitted as well, walked from the build's own captured outer/inner inode
layout (`PFSBuilder.CaptureImageTree`). They are self-consistent snapshots of this library's image, not
byte matches of a specific reference: the outer superblock `<icv>` is the real captured superblock HMAC
and the `<seed>` is all-zero, but because this library writes a superblock-first outer PFS while
the reference layout is data-first the reported block indices and metadata offsets differ, and the nested
`<metadata>` pseudo-element and per-file `poffset` are intentionally omitted. Inner `sce_sys` files packed
as outer CNT entries (e.g. `icon0.png`) receive no inner inode and are correctly absent from the
`<nested-image>` tree. These trees are informational metadata that the console loader does not read.
The keyed `naps_meta_18.dat` blob is never fabricated. See
[implementation-status.md](implementation-status.md).

## 6. End-to-end creation process

Putting the pieces together, the library builds a package as follows:

1. **Validate inputs** — content id (36 chars), title id, and passcode (32 chars). Optionally generate a minimal `param.json` if the source folder
   lacks one.
2. **Generate auxiliary `sce_sys` files** — `about/right.sprx`, `playgo-chunk.dat`,
   `playgo-manifest.xml`, and the BC7 DDS siblings of the icon/picture images — so the file set
   is complete.
3. **Lay out the inner PFS** — walk the folder into a plaintext inner-PFS image with the SHA-256
   Merkle tree and the correct (PS5) superblock version.
4. **Render the inner image** — leave it plaintext, **AES-XTS-encrypt** it with the EKPFS
   (the `pfs-image-key`; §3.3), or **PFSC-compress** it.
5. **Build the outer PFS + `\x7FCNT`** — assemble the metadata container, the entry table and
   the entry-name table around the inner image. Any backend-authored system file supplied under
   `sce_sys/` (license, network-platform, self-info, delta-info, keymap_rp, changeinfo,
   pronunciation, trophy; §8.1) is added here as an outer CNT entry with its fixed id.
6. **Sign the metadata** — RSA-3072 / SHA-256.
7. **Finalize** — wrap the container and shared PFS image into a `\x7FFIH` **debug** image
   (signed byte `0x00`), writing the FIH header and the segment offsets/sizes.

The result round-trips through `ProsperoPkgReader` as a full debug image whose embedded
container and shared PFS image are intact.

## 8. `sce_sys` / `sce_suppl` metadata files

These auxiliary files fall into two groups. `imagedigs.dat` and the PlayGo files (`playgo-chunk.dat`,
`playgo-hash-table.dat`, `playgo-ficm.dat`) are **outer-CNT body entries** — they live in the `\x7FCNT`
container metadata, NOT inside the inner PFS image. (An extractor presents them under a `sce_sys/` view,
which historically caused them to be modelled as inner-PFS files; they are not.) The `sce_suppl/common/etc`
SI archive (`naps_meta_*`, the second `playgo-chunk.dat` copy, `pfsimage.xml`) is a separate supplemental
stream. CNT-entry placement for each file is described below.

| File | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `imagedigs.dat` | CNT entry `0x040A` (unnamed) | `N × 32` byte digest table, one entry per 64 KiB **outer** image block (e.g. 11 blocks = 352 B). **Now computed end-to-end:** the outer-PFS builder captures the per-block descriptor digests of the finalized outer image (`CaptureImageDigests`), and the builder patches them into the entry after `WriteImage`. Each stored 32-byte digest is written in byte-reversed order. Because it digests the outer image but does **not** live in it, there is no self-reference / fixpoint — the build is single-pass and the entry size (`outerBlocks × 32`) is known up front. Self-consistent with this encoder's actual block content (byte-identity to a specific reference package still requires byte-identical Kraken). |
| `playgo-chunk.dat` | CNT entry `0x1001` **and** `sce_suppl/common/etc` (SI) | 416-byte PlayGo chunk descriptor. The two copies are **byte-identical**. Generated by `PlayGo.ProsperoPlayGo.BuildChunkDat`. |
| `playgo-hash-table.dat` | CNT entry `0x2010` | PlayGo file hash table; `0x38 + n × 8` bytes (n = `ficmCount / 2`). A content-independent constant structure (version=1, `\x7FFLT` magic at `0x18`, fixed 16-byte prefix + `n × 8` constant table entries). `PlayGo.ProsperoPlayGo.BuildHashTable`. |
| `playgo-ficm.dat` | CNT entry `0x2011` | PlayGo file-in-chunk map; 16-byte header + `fileCount` bytes. `PlayGo.ProsperoPlayGo.BuildFicm`. |
| `playgo-chunk.crc` | `config/<content-id>/` (SI) | CRC-32C over each 64 KiB block of the finalized mount image. `ProsperoPlayGo.BuildChunkCrc`. |
| `naps_meta_18.dat` | `sce_suppl/common/etc` (SI) | Per-package NAPS metric blob; size varies per package (e.g. 3440 / 7936 B). Supplied verbatim. |
| `naps_meta_300/301/302/308.dat` | `sce_suppl/common/etc` (SI) | 48-byte NAPS records; `301/302/308` are byte-identical to `300`. Reproduced byte-exact (`ProsperoNapsMeta`). |
| `pfsimage.xml` | `sce_suppl/common/etc` (SI) | Machine-readable image descriptor; reproduced through `<entries>` plus the `<chunkinfo>`/`<pfs-image>`/`<nested-image>` introspection trees (self-consistent; see §5.4). |

> **`naps_pkg_layout.dat` is NOT present in `nwonly` debug packages.** LibProsperoPkg includes a round-trip serializer/parser (`ProsperoNapsLayout`) for completeness but never fabricates the file.

### 8.1 Supplied system files

The source folder may contain backend-authored files under `sce_sys/` that carry a fixed CNT id:
`license.dat` / `license.info`, `nptitle.dat`, `npbind.dat`, `selfinfo.dat`,
`origin-deltainfo.dat` / `target-deltainfo.dat`, `pubtoolinfo.dat`, `pronunciation.xml` /
`pronunciation.sig`, `changeinfo/changeinfo*.xml`, the `keymap_rp/` image set, and the `trophy/`
archives.

These are **outer-CNT body entries**, not inner-PFS files: the inner-image builder keeps every
named system file out of the inner PFS, so they are carried in the `\x7FCNT` container instead.
LibProsperoPkg packs each supplied file whose `sce_sys`-relative path maps to a known entry id
(`ProsperoPkgBuilder.CollectMediaEntries`); files that are absent are simply skipped. The payloads
are produced by a signing backend and are stored verbatim — the library does not generate them.

`keymap_rp` uses two path shapes, flat `keymap_rp/0NN.png` and nested `keymap_rp/NN/0NN.png`; each
image is its own CNT entry. The key-map set is capped at 1 MiB total.

Because the standard `nwonly` debug package supplies none of these files, its CNT stays at
13 entries. Each supplied system file adds one entry.

### 8.2 UCP archives (`trophy2/*.ucp`, `uds/*.ucp`)

The trophy set and universal data system are carried as UCP archives inside the inner PFS
(`sce_sys/trophy2/trophyNN.ucp`, `sce_sys/uds/udsNN.ucp`). Unlike the signed system files in §8.1,
UCP archives are inner-PFS files and are fully producible.

A UCP file is a flat container: a `0x60`-byte big-endian header (magic `0xB228C60A`, version 1, total
size, entry count, and a 20-byte SHA-1 digest at `0x1C`) followed by `0x40`-byte entry records
(32-byte name, u64 offset, u64 size) sorted in ascending ordinal name order, then the blobs. Each
blob begins at the next strictly-greater 16-byte boundary after the previous blob's end. The digest
is a plain SHA-1 over the whole file with the digest field zeroed, so it can be verified and repaired
without keys.

`Content.ProsperoUcp` reads, builds (from entries or from a directory), validates, verifies, and
repairs UCP files; the round-trip is byte-exact on the reference samples. During a build,
`ProsperoPkgBuilder.EnsureUcpArchives` repairs a stale digest on a supplied archive but never
synthesizes its contents.

### 8.3 System-file validation

Before packing, backend-signed files are structurally validated by `PKG.ProsperoSystemFiles`:
`npbind.dat` (532 bytes, magic `0xD294A018`, communication id in the TLV chain at `0x80`) and
`nptitle.dat` (160 bytes, magic `NPTD`, title id at `0x10`) are checked and their identifiers
extracted; `license.dat` / `license.info` require a non-empty payload. A malformed file stops the
build with a descriptive error rather than producing an invalid package.

### 8.4 SELF container and fake-self

`sce_sys/about/right.sprx` is a SELF (Signed ELF) module. `Content.ProsperoFself` parses the SELF
header, segment table, embedded ELF header and program headers, and the extended-info block, and can
generate a fake-self from any 64-bit ELF with `MakeFself`.

The generator emits a digest/data segment pair for each program header whose file size is non-zero and
whose type is `PT_LOAD`, module-data (`0x61000000`), relro (`0x61000010`), or comment (`0x6FFFFF00`),
in program-header index order. The extended-info digest is `SHA-256` of the input ELF; the authority id
and program type are derived from the ELF type and the byte at file offset `0x3f00`; digest and
signature slots are zero-filled. A generated module round-trips through the parser and reproduces the
segment layout of the reference module. Package builds embed a fixed `right.sprx` asset when the source
provides none (§6); the generator is a standalone capability for arbitrary ELF input.

> **Reproducibility boundary.** The keyed digests (`content/game/header/system/param/package/body/sblock/fixed-info` digests, the superblock `icv`, the FIH finalization table) require console finalization material the library does not have. LibProsperoPkg computes the SHA3-256 CNT-region and entry digests and derives `imagedigs.dat` from its own finalized outer image; the remaining console-only finalization fields are emitted as structurally valid placeholders (reported as warnings). Byte-identity to a specific reference `.pkg` additionally requires the Kraken inner encoder to produce identical compressed output.
